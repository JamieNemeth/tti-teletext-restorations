This repository contains aesthetic restorations of teletext recovered from VHS tapes (using [@ali1234](https://github.com/ali1234)'s [vhs-teletext](https://github.com/ali1234/vhs-teletext) software) and converted into the MRG systems TTI format (plain text files compatible with [@peterkvt80](https://github.com/peterkvt80)'s [VBIT2](https://github.com/peterkvt80/vbit2) software for display on a real teletext TV).

### What does 'aesthetic restoration' mean?

My aim is to restore all recovered pages faithfully, exactly as broadcast. But sometimes I just want to have a nostalgic browse of the recovered service myself on a proper telly, total immersion, and as many pages as possible.

An 'aesthetic restoration' is one where I've done my best to restore a page properly and correctly, with checksums checked and parity corrected etc., but I haven't quite managed it yet. The resulting TTI file is therefore an interim file where everything *looks* correct, and feels right (to me), but some artistic license may have been used.

Anything that meets archival standards will be added to the [recovered teletext page restoration project](https://github.com/teletext-restoration/teletext-restoration).

*Full circle: Page 300 from Sbectel (circa 1999), which I recovered from one of my own VHS tapes, aesthetically restored and converted to TTI format, then converted into a composite video teletext signal using VBIT2 running on a Raspberry Pi in the attic, and piped around the house over UHF. As far as the TV is concerned, the teletext signal coming from the aerial socket is almost exactly as it would have originally been broadcast, and pressing the TEXT button on the remote makes everything appear and work just like it originally would have, albeit with today's date and time.*
